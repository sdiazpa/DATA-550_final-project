## Brief Description of Contents of Report

Within this report, you will find an analysis based on the dataset from UCI ML Repository. [This dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records) explores the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure. Featured within the dataset are 13 clinic variables with data collected during follow-up periods of the study. A cleaned version of this dataset is stored within the ‘ready-data’ folder as a .rds file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **To generate the final report: (in terminal)**

1.  Clear the contents of any already made products using ‘make clean’.

2.  After all items are cleared from the ‘Tables’ and ‘Figures’ folders, use ‘make’ to complete the final report, titled ‘Final-project.html’.
